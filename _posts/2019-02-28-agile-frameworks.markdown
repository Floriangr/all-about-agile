<p>Hello
Agilistas,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I recently
walked through an E.ON hallway and heard someone say: „This team better have a
good reason to switch from Scrum to Kanban. Scrum has so much more spelt-out
process associated to it.” I guess the underlying thinking was something like
this: Agile is a fixed methodology which can be clearly defined (usually by
Scrum). The closer a team gets to the Scrum Guide in its way of working, the
more productive it will become. This reflects the beliefs of several people I
have come across. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see Agile
differently: Scrum is but one solution (often a good one) to be Agile with its associated
limitations (more about this in another post). However, circumstances across
teams across companies, countries and cultures vary. Out-of-the-book Scrum may
be great for one team but not so suitable for another. Instead, what is
important are the underlying principles which guide in solving the problem of
doing good product development, e.g. the Agile Manifesto (<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a>). Distilled to their essence, I think two points are key:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>The product team continuously
delights its customers</li><li>In doing so, the team never ceases
to get better</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good
Agile implementation should make sure this happens. How they do it is
irrelevant. Approaching Agile this way enables creative solutions and
experimentation on how to best develop great products. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An example
from my team illustrates this: Some time back we have stopped all-team backlog
refinement. Opposed to general Scrum practice, the team generally splits into
smaller groups which each refine a few upcoming features and then present the
result to the entire team in another session. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This “Scrum
anti-pattern” makes a lot of sense for us: This team is developing components
for a Content Management System which is quite mature. This means: First, there
are currently few very big new features coming up. Hence, components can
generally be delivered by one or two developers in a reasonable time. It’s not
required that the whole team is deeply involved in preparing each Story.
Second, every component is rather close to a single product itself.
Consequently, the linkages between features are much less than in other
products: Hence, stories can mostly be prepared independently of each other. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The result
is that we need shorter meetings making developers happy and the team is more
productive making the business happy. Of course, when this way of working stops
to make sense we will change it. For us it’s this what’s meant by Agile: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>A context-specific emergent implementation of
Agile values</em>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other teams
will have different problems which likely will not all be well solved by Scrum.
Following an Agile mindset, they should try out different things that help them
get closer to their customers and become more productive. Whether their way of
working fits a certain label does not matter. Of course, this doesn’t mean that
Agile methodologies like, Scrum, Kanban, SaFe, LeSS, etc. are irrelevant. Their
ideas are great in informing potential solutions to (often recurring) problems
of product development. What should not happen, however, is that any one framework
becomes a cage stifling the creative potential of teams to find the best way to
work. </p>
