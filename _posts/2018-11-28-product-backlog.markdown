Hello Agilistas,

Do not give work to your Agile team according to developer specialization. Provide work solely based on value as reflected in the priorities of the Product Backlog.

In this post I want to elaborate this principle and point out the effects this will likely have on your team and organization. I'm going to argue that this will lead to more value delivered and improved team performance over the mid- and long-term.

The Status Quo: functional developer specialization leads to restricted team performance

First of all let's look at the status quo in many Agile teams. Often developers will, due to traditional working practices, be highly specialized. Probably there will be frontend developers, backend developers, designers, (automation) testers, etc. All of these are used to work on User Stories related to their specialty. However, the Product Backlog is not prioritized according to the current skills of team members. Thus, a frontend-focused Story may not be highest priority - yet the respective developer would request it to be inserted into the next Sprint so he or she can keep working.

This way of operating leads to significant disadvantages: Value is lost as the team does not constantly focus on the highest prio items and Agility reduced as the Product Owner cannot flexibly reprioritize the Product Backlog, knowing that the team will pick up the next highest item. Furthermore, the developers will likely not grow into one team as they keep working apart from each other.  It also limits learning as developers will only focus on Stories which fit their existing skillset. Lastly, if Stories correspond to Developers, only one developer (or in the best case one functional group, e.g. Frontend) will be working on a Story at any one time which limits flow. Luckily teamwork doesn't have to be this way. I will elaborate below what happens when the Backlog is the only driver of work.

Adhering to Backlog priorities results in more value delivered, improved teamwork and higher flow

Let's look at what happens when work is only driven by business priorities as reflected in the order of the Product Backlog.

First of all, value is maximized: the Backlog is worked on in exactly the order in which it is set-up. No less valuable feature will be pulled up to occupy a specialized developer. Connected to this, the PO can prioritize the Backlog with complete flexibility knowing that there are no restrictions in terms of who can work on what. Whatever Story is on top the team will work on next.

Doing this also increases teamwork and team learning. Developers will at times have to work on Stories which do not perfectly fit their specialization. To do this, they must collaborate with the rest of the team, e.g. pair-program with someone more experienced in a certain discipline or start with an easier task of a Story.  To make this happen, they must communicate more within the team and coordinate work. This will support the breakup of silos and the team to grow into one unit.

By working in this way, developers will also learn new skills and become even better in delivering value to the customers. An example received from Bas Vodde at a recent training illustrates this: his team lacked a trained designer hence a developer decided to learn Photoshop. Now he very quickly realized that many of the tasks he had to perform in Photoshop were rather repetitive. This made him learn the program's scripting language and automate those which resulted in higher output and less tedium. Being able to work cross-functionally leads to more productivity as team members can better support each other and bring insights from one discipline to bear upon another. This will of course not lead to completely interchangeable developers. Everyone will retain areas in which he or she is most experienced and will work in most often.

A more cross-functional team can also effect an improvement in the flow of Stories. Instead of developers working on Stories as individuals, more developers can collaborate on a Story and complete it faster. This means that the highest prio Stories get delivered more quickly, again maximizing value. Incidentally, this collaboration also improves architecture and code quality due to more discussion on a feature and results in a shared understanding of the entire codebase enabling better coding decisions and bug fixing. As it turns out this is also a more fun of working.

The ambition and the resulting benefits seem clear. Why is the Status Quo so sticky?

As it were, many teams are not yet working this way. Let's look into the reasons for this.

There are two common objections from organizations which are not yet used to this way of working, one from the business and one from the team: the business will likely be concerned about lower productivity and the team about the feasibility of working in this manner.

The business concern about lower productivity generally arises out of a worldview which still results from a manufacturing / factory perspective: Machines (now termed "developers") have fixed capabilities and their output must be maximized (Curiously, even this perspective is false: see Goldratt, The Goal). However, people are not machines and hence can learn and adapt. It is likely that in the beginning of this transition, velocity will be somewhat lower as the team needs to get into this new working mode. However, all other advantages already listed, value focus, better quality features and codebase comprehension should outweigh the learning curve very soon and convince Management to try this out.

A second objection may come from developers: they may wonder about the feasibility of them acquiring expertise in previously unknown areas or may also doubt the productivity of sharing the work on a User Story. A team discussion on this with an experienced Scrum Master or Agile Coach, a how-to brownbag session or even the visit to another team already working in this manner will hopefully go a long way in allaying these concerns. Furthermore, to support the developers in trying this out, management needs to clearly communicate that it supports the team in taking the time to improve its way of working and to learn new skills.

To summarize, allocating work only according to the order of Product Backlog items and not according to functional specialization not only increases value delivered but also leads to improved teamwork and learning over time. So don't be held back by calls of "we must maximize developer output" and "we will never be able to do this" and try it out.

Any feedback about this way of working? What works well what doesn't? As always your comments are highly appreciated!
