<p>Hello product developers,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Agile creates value no matter the size of an enterprise. However, the challenges for an Agile adoption tend to be different between start-ups and multinational corporations. In this post I will talk about the value of Agile and the challenges for enterprises and start-ups in realizing this value.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d like to start with explaining some core Agile principles which support value creation: <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>User-centricity: understanding users’ problems and coming up with tailored solutions to add value to users and earn revenues for products offered.</li><li>Value-driven prioritization: understanding the value of different features and always focusing on the most valuable ones to do next. This results in minimized waste of time and resources and the possibility to quickly pivot to serve newly discovered customer needs.</li><li>Transparency: having visibility on the work and business processes to be able to see and remove problems. This enables continuously rising productivity and employee satisfaction.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<p>No matter the size of the company, these principles are important. However, the hurdles to their realization are quite different: in the enterprise it’s generally too much of process, in the start-up too little. Let’s look at what’s often going wrong in the two worlds.<br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Agility in the enterprise is many times impeded by an overly rigid structure and too much involvement from too many stakeholders - often a side-effect of larger bureaucracies. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>User-centricity is in danger: The dev team and the user are often too far removed from each other. In the worst case, there is a so-called “Innovation Department” which is creating new solutions that (often much later) are implemented by delivery teams. In a somewhat better case, there is a “Customer Feedback Unit” that is gathering intelligence and then provides this to a team in an aggregated form. Both is not good. Real user-centricity can only happen if a Product Team is fully responsible for the value proposition and its evolution. The team needs to be able to continuously talk to users to understand their pain points, create solution proposition and test these again. Only then should it implement anything. </li><li>Prioritization often doesn’t work well either in the entreprise. In many cases there is no designated Product Owner (PO) or he/she isn’t empowered. This results in different stakeholders pushing their priorities and generally the HIPPO (highest paid person’s opinion) wins. The company loses as features are not prioritized according to their value. Politics rule. </li><li>Transparency often doesn’t exist either. Feature requests may be stored in different places, criteria for prioritization are unclear and business processes affecting the team are not hidden from developers. This leads to loss of lower productivity: You cannot improve what you do not see and understand. Also, motivation decreases as the team feels it is not in control of its environment, controlled by invisible external forces. </li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People in the enterprise must be constantly vigilant to work against these threats to Agility. Otherwise the company will eventually be paralyzed and innovation will be blocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a start-up Agility comes more natural but danger appears from the opposite side: chaos due to too little of process and structure. <br></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Often in start-ups the user is not at the center but a predetermined solution is: this problem comes from teams forming around an idea about how to solve a problem or maybe even around an already-created solution. Once this happens it is difficult to step back again and ask: do we really understand our customers and their problems and how can we best address those? This is dangerous: no matter how good the team, a fixation on one solution misses an opportunity to adapt to the exact context of a market or may even miss customer needs entirely. </li><li>Prioritization often doesn’t work well either: there is no common alignment around a shared way to value items and decide on what to do. In contrast, the team members themselves may decide on what they personally find most valuable to work on next. This is generally because no effective Backlog management has been set-up which may lead to suboptimal results or even conflicting decisions. Customers are quickly aggravated when the start-up doesn’t speak with one voice or promises made do not materialize in the agreed manner. </li><li>Transparency may also suffer: even though, due to their size, start-ups have much less organizational complexity if they do not spell out their implicit processes and ways of working these may quickly become confusing. Even more so when the second generation of employees joins the team. The same applies to the Product Backlog. If there is no shared upcoming feature list but every employee has their personal to-do list, it is unclear what everyone is currently working on and what they will do next. This can lead to double-work and lost improvement potential as you cannot change what you cannot see. </li></ul>

<p>To be successful and prove relevance, start-ups need to put work into creating and evolving a framework to manage day-to-day business and innovation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I have tried to show, Agility is important for both the enterprise and the start-up even if challenges to implement it can be vastly different.<br></p>

<p>What do you think about how start-ups should ensure user-centricity, value-driven prioritization and transparency?<br></p>
