Hello world,

the bigger a firm, the higher its degree of functional specialization on average. A large company contains Sales, HR, Marketing, Finance, Accounting, Procurement, IT and many other departments (or functions). The driver for this functional separation are expected benefits of specialization (or economies of skill) and economies of scale & scope. Hence, an efficient company needs these divisions.

Or so we think...

Within IT, Scrum has been very successful, based on the rejection of functional divisions. The same case can be made for a company as a whole. In this article, I'm going to set out the case against functional separation and in favor of fully enabled teams which have insourced and therefore eliminated external dependencies: e.g. a team member is responsible for tasks previously located externally such as HR. I will then explain what we can generalize from this about the company of the future.

The old IT world, functionally split and not a fun place to work

To understand the argument against functional division let's go back in time into an IT world which was mainly structured along functional lines. In these days, software development was cumbersome, lengthy, boring and expensive. A (simplified) software product development cycle looked something like this: Analysts specified requirements, backend developers wrote part of the code, front end developers another part, testers tested the complete product and operations maintained and ran it. A highly specialized and a highly inefficient way of working: It took a very long time to release a buggy product customers didn't want. Departments then blamed each other for the result. Life in software development wasn't fun.

Functional division is at the root of the problem

An important reason for this was functional division, i.e. external dependencies. We know this principle from every part of life. Whenever you need anything from anyone not close to you, things become difficult. Imagine any interaction between you and another department at your company. This often takes much more time than you had originally expected. Often you don't get what you wanted and must ask again. Why?

There are five reasons to explain this:

Incentivation: Often there is a mismatch of goals between your two units (e.g. one is a profit center, the other a cost center).
Prioritization: Maybe incentivation is right but the other unit still prioritizes your request incorrectly due to not optimal processes, mistakes, lacking information or knowledge.
Communication: You would likely not talk face-to-face. Maybe you miscommunicate or the other party misunderstands content or priority.
Lack of personal connection: The other party probably doesn't know you. Personal liking or team spirit does not grease the interchange.
Different world views or cultures: Sales (customer focused) and Procurement (efficiency focused) may not see the world equally and hence treat issues differently. You may get something but it's not what you wanted.
How Scrum solves this frictional loss through insourcing of dependencies

Agile Scrum teams have proven to offer a solution. A Scrum team contains (user experience) designers, business analysts, frontend and backend developers and testers (among others). It doesn't only develop but also runs and maintains software (DevOps).

This solves the problems mentioned above: The whole team is incentivized to work towards the same goal and has a clear view over its roadmap and can hence prioritize tasks optimally. Communication is quick (usually the team is co-located) and team members (generally) like each other, develop an "esprit de corps" and hence want to help each other out. The whole team works  on a shared goal (in my case: produce great components for eon.com) and hence maintains a common view on its tasks.

What we can learn from Scrum about the future of the firm

I am convinced this logic also applies to the firm as a whole and shows us its likely future: (1) a radically simplified structure, (2) self-organization within the firm and (3) the disappearance of structural hierarchy.

In terms of structure: I envision a loosely-coupled aggregation of teams. These could be customer-facing and develop, produce and market the whole product (e.g. a software solution) or could be internal (e.g. organized around the production of a physical product). These teams will self-organize and collaborate on a need basis through loose associations (“guilds” in Agile terms) (e.g. for tasks for which they see synergies such as the purchase of a company-wide software solution). Overhead will be minimal as most required support functions will be insourced. For instance, teams will be responsible for their HR or procurement activities. As a consequence, support functions will, apart from few exceptions, disappear.
Self-organization will shape the firm’s internal structure. Unlike current companies in which one has a defined role within a defined business unit, future firms will, like Agile, trust on employees being self-motivated and entrepreneurial. Hence, employees decide on which tasks or products they want to work and form teams respectively or launch new business ideas. This works because of a fundamental principle of why markets function: distributed knowledge. Individuals know local conditions best and can respond accordingly. As knowledge moves up the pyramid of a traditional company, the less accurate and the more politicized it often becomes (apart from the process being slow). In future firms, teams will research business hypotheses, experiment, evaluate and act upon the results. Teams working on bad ideas will dissolve; promising business models will attract employees. This greatly reduces business risk. As opposed to the whole company adopting a new technology or committing to a big bang launch, a team tries out something first. If it works, other teams will copy and good ideas will diffuse throughout the business, bad ideas die.
Structural hierarchy will (mostly) disappear: Scrum teams don't have a manager as this would hinder effective self-organization and reduce their sense of ownership. Accordingly, I expect a general obsolescence of management. As teams are empowered to decide on everything it takes to get their job done (including staffing, performance management, etc.), the tasks of a “traditional” manager largely become unnecessary. Does this mean, we can do completely without leadership? I think not. Teams will still need training and coaching and require a company vision and broad strategy. The company’s servant leaders will provide this support.
The future has already started

A good example where we can already have a glimpse at the future is Valve, the producer of the online gaming platform "Steam".  A fast-growing and successful multi-billion company, they work according to an anarcho-syndicalist model which I understand to be close to the presented vision (See here for more information).

To conclude, at the example of Scrum I have explained why multi-functional teams are good whilst functional separation hinders a business. From this I set out a theory of a “future” firm based on multi-skilled, self-organized teams and empowered teams. I am convinced this provides not only large efficiency advantages for the company. Employees will work self-determined on diverse tasks with motivated colleagues. An exciting evolution we should look forward to.

Agree or disagree? Please leave a comment. I'm looking forward to your thoughts on this.
