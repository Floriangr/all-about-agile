Hello Agilistas,

a couple of weeks back, one of the Scrum teams I was working with became frustrated with its Sprint Review. They discussed to shorten it as they saw their time coding better spent. They were right: The Review was run in a way which did make it lengthy and rather boring. Its objective was mainly to receive Product Owner (PO) sign-off for done stories. Consequently, there was little discussion or interaction during the meeting.

Reviews thus conducted really make it rather hard to elicit much enthusiasm from participants. Luckily, this doesn’t have to be so. Reviews have the potential to be among the most exciting and value-providing Sprint meetings. To realize this, however, they must be focused externally, centered on the future and target feedback and learning. In this post, I will discuss these aspects and then elaborate on three pre-conditions which should be met to make a Review a success.

Before, some more words on why the former set-up didn’t work: A Sprint Review centered on getting PO sign-off is inefficient and may even fail on this very objective. It is difficult in such a large round to really explore completed functionality in the required depth to approve it with a view on all acceptance criteria. Hence, the team ends up with only a cursory approval which will likely lead to problems later when a feature doesn’t work as expected. In addition, even a superficial exploration takes away too much time as generally only the PO and the respective developer are active. The rest of the team is rather uninvolved. Not very Agile and resulting in minimal value-add. No surprise the meeting bores everyone.

Better: Focus the Review externally, on the future and on business feedback.

What does this mean?

Focus the meeting externally: A Review with only the team and the PO participating is insufficient. Everyone with a stake in the current development activities should be present to be up to date on new features and, even more important, to collect their feedback regarding next steps and priorities (not to overrule the PO but to make organizational priorities transparent to the entire team). This discussion happens mainly during two stages of the meeting: After the demonstration of a Done Story and in the end when the PO presents the upcoming Backlog items.

Focus on the future: A Story sign-off meeting is backward-looking which limits its effectiveness. When presenting completed Stories, the attention should rather be to compare where the organization is now and where it wants to be. This enables a discussion on how to close the delta and the importance and urgency of individual actions to do so.

Focus on receiving feedback: Showcasing finished work is not an aim in itself. It really becomes value-creating when the demonstration of a feature becomes the starting point to explore next steps. To make this possible, sufficient time to allow for feedback and an open discussion is necessary after each presentation. The PO and Scrum Master should note ideas for new Stories and views on prioritizations to serve as inspiration for work on the backlog.

You should do three things to make the Review a success: Get PO Story sign-off before the Review, convince stakeholders to attend, and come prepared.

Get PO sign-off before the meeting: This is necessary for the team to present stories in a united and self-confident manner. If the PO does not fully stand behind all work presented, chances are that stakeholders will notice and question the output. Even worse, PO criticism of work done will likely encourage stakeholders to do the same. The meeting will probably end up unconstructive and unproductive. To prevent this, the PO must have accepted all presented Stories in advance of the Review. This, of course, demands some coordination between the team and PO to align sign-off slots. A smooth flow of finalized Stories throughout the Sprint supports this as the completion of every Story last minute makes timely PO sign-off rather difficult.

Convince relevant stakeholders to attend: The best preparation is in vain if stakeholders are not present. As individuals with a say about a product generally have a busy agenda, it may not be sufficient to merely invite them. The PO or Scrum Master are tasked with making the case why their participation is vital for value creation during this meeting and why stakeholders also benefit from being up-to-date on the product. In addition, some education about the purpose and agenda of the meeting may be required. It must be clear to all participants that a Review is not a Steering Committee meeting: Stakeholder feedback is valuable and highly appreciated but decisions about the product are made by the PO.

Come prepared: This starts with getting all required IT up and running in advance but most importantly refers to the actual presentation of Stories done. To realize the potential of this meeting, stakeholders must understand the work presented. Otherwise, no valuable feedback can be given, and business participants will likely not return. A good approach is for the PO to give a high-level introduction to clarify the context and problem solved for each Story. A developer can then take over to demo the functionality without going into the actual code. Some thinking about how to best do this is required beforehand. Subsequently, stakeholders ideally have the opportunity to try out the feature themselves.

Tech or testing Stories which do not provide direct value to business stakeholders should not be part of this Review. Something which has worked well for my teams was to split the Review in half, focusing on User Stories first. Stakeholder participation is requested for this part. In the second half, the team would demo any other completed work with a technical focus. Business participation for this is optional.

To summarize, a Sprint Review should include central business stakeholders and it should focus on the future evolution of the product. To make this possible, business feedback is critical. Running the meeting in such a manner requires previous PO sign-off, stakeholders attending and a prepared team. Done that you have set the stage for a great Review which will not only deliver valuable input but will also be fun for all participants. At least in the case of the teams I’m working with, no further demands for shortened Reviews have come up (so far…).

Do you agree? Any important points I didn't cover? Please leave a comment, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
