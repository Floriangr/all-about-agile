Hello Agilistas,

has your Scrum team ever thought that it's lacking general principles for action? Or that finding consensus on a guide for interaction would help improve team cohesion and productivity?

These were some thoughts that made us want to create an Agile team charter and state our most important values for the eon.com team (a.k.a. the Unicorn Squad).  A recent offsite at the Baldeney lake in Essen was the ideal place to do this. As our concept worked rather well, I want to give you an overview about how we went abour getting there.

Below our Agenda as guide for the day:

I started the event with a brief intro about the background of the workshop, what we were aiming for and why. As I see it, team values serve three objectives:

Having done so, I set out what kind of values we were looking for:

After the intro, I distributed printouts to each team member with exemplary values and short definitions from different sources (you can find these at the end of this post). This served as (non-comprehensive) inspiration for the creation of our team values.

Before individually writing down our most important values, I thought that a group discussion about important values would help create some alignment and get an understanding for each others' concerns. I made sure to ask every team member to speak up in this discussion and documented the results directly on the wall (or a window in this case).

Having completed this discussion, I asked the team to write down their six most significant values on a card each. We again put them on the window and clustered them. As it turned out there were seven values which many team members agreed on:

Fun, Trust, Open Mind, Respect, Speed, Quality and Continuous Improvement.

We then did an overall sanity check and discussed whether these really were the ones we wanted to stick with. Luckily they were, one of the main deliverables was done. What we were still missing at this point, was an aligned definition of each value and at least one example situation in which this value was relevant (in order to really make it tangible).

We did this in groups of at least two people writing a draft definition and example for each value. Every group then presented its proposal, the team giving feedback and revising the content jointly with the presenters. For this, we really had to be precise which hence turned out to be the longest part of the session.

Nevertheless, we managed to finalize each of the seven values. Now we considered it important to find out whether the team really still stood behind the final result. If not, these values would not have been valuable at all and perhabs even be counter-productive. We checked this by a secret vote and yes, every single Unicorn was in favor of adopting them! :)

What now? In order to increase engagement with the charter, we took large and thick sheets of white paper and jointly painted the values on them (luckily we are a cross-functional team and had some designers with us...) as well as some supporting illustrations.

After we were done with this, we again returned to more mundane topics and discussed practical implications: "Now, having a clear value guidance, should we do anything different in our way of working"? And indeed we came to some ideas, e.g. that Continuous Improvement also applies to individuals and we need good feedback for this. Hence, we are going to establish a team-internal feedback mechanism so everyone can easily give and receive feedback to get better. Maybe a topic for an upcoming post...

All in all this took around 5.5 hours, a projector, a flipchart and several hundred sticky notes. I hope a worthy investment to improve our teamwork.

I hope you found this interesting and helpful! If you have feedback, questions or comments on how you have done something similar, please get in touch.
